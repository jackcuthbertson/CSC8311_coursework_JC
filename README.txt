Restriction Site Remover

This program reads a DNA sequence that is fed in as a FASTA file and will remove unwanted restriction sites. 
This program can be used to produce BioBrick compatible sequences, but is also helpful with other DNA assembly methods that require restriction sites.

How to use.

Run build.py with python3
The program will ask you which restriction sites you wish to use.
It has 4 restriction sites built in automatically, EcoR1, Xba1, Spe1, Pst1.
If you wish to look for another restriction site please type in what the recognition site is.
The program will check to make sure the entered sequence is valid or not and will prompt you again if it is not.
